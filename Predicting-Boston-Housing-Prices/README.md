# Supervised Learning
## Project: [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning/tree/master/projects/boston_housing)

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to apply machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. 

This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for clients\' homes.

## Project Highlights

Skills learned by completing this project:
- How to use NumPy to investigate the latent features of a dataset.
- How to analyze various learning performance plots for variance and bias.
- How to determine the best-guess model for predictions from unseen data.
- How to evaluate a model's performance on unseen data using previous data.

## Requirements
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

## Starting the Project

This project contains three files:

- `boston_housing.ipynb`: Contains the model.
- `housing.csv`: The project dataset.
- `visuals.py`: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project.

In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the **src** folder and then use the following commands:
```bash
ipython notebook boston_housing.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb
```
