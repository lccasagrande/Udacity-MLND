## Overview
This repository contains all the projects I did for the Udacity's MLND Program.

The original files (without the answers) can be found in [Udacity's Github ML Repository](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning) and my capstone project can be found [here](https://github.com/lccasagrande/Deep-Knowledge-Tracing).

## Requirements
You'll need Python to be able to run theses projects. If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which has almost all packages required in these projects. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

## Starting the Project
The instructions to run the projects can be found inside each project's dir.
