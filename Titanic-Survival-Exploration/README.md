## Project: [Titanic Survival Exploration](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning/tree/master/projects/smartcab)

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger's features, such as sex and age. 

## Software Requirements
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

If you already have Python 2.7 installed on your computer, then you can install `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` and Jupyter Notebook (formerly known as "iPython") by using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) on the command line. [This page](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) may also be of use for some packages for Windows users, if pip has trouble performing the installation. After installing pip, you can install all the packages with the following command:

`sudo pip install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter`

## Starting the Project
This project contains three files:

- `titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb`: This is the main file.
- `titanic_data.csv`: The project dataset. 
- `visuals.py`: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project.

In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the **src** folder and then use the command:
`jupyter notebook titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb`
